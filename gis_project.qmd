## Methods Overview

Our analysis used a series of spatial operations in ArcGIS ModelBuilder and Geoprocessing tools. Key components included land classification, contamination filtering, proximity analysis, and regression modeling.

### Part 1: Agricultural Land Area Calculation

We used **Select**, **Intersect**, **Dissolve**, and **Field Calculator** to calculate the percent area of cropland and ranchland per groundwater basin.

### Part 2: Domestic Wells and Land Use

Using **Spatial Join**, **Union**, and **Clip**, we filtered and merged domestic wells with cropland and ranchland overlays to assess shared basin locations.

### Part 3: Nitrate and Other Contaminants

Wells were filtered for key contaminants. Nitrate emerged as most significant (EPA MCL \>10 mg/L), and wells exceeding this were isolated for further analysis.

### Part 4: Proximity Analysis

Used the **Near** tool to calculate distance (km) from each well to nearest cropland and ranchland, enabling spatial exposure analysis.

### Part 5: Pesticide Use Integration

Standardized county names and joined pesticide rates to the well dataset to allow exploration of fertilizer impact on contamination.

### Part 6: Linear Regression Analysis

Used **OLS** (Ordinary Least Squares) to model nitrate concentrations as a function of:

\- Percent cropland and ranchland in basin\
- Distance to cropland and ranchland\
- (Future work) Pesticide application rates
