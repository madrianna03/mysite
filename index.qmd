### Welcome!

Hello and welcome to my page! My name is Adrianna Martinez and I am a first-generation student completing my fourth year of undergrad at the University of California Santa Barbara. I am pursuing a Bachelor’s of Science in Environmental Studies with a minor in Earth Science. 

Growing up in the heart of Las Vegas, NV, my passion for the outdoors and appreciation for understanding environmental processes began to flourish, driving my academic and career goals today. Throughout undergrad, my curiosity towards geology quickly developed into a strong fascination with tectonics, fluids, and mineral systems, specifically how subduction, metamorphism, and crustal deformation influence ore deposit formation, groundwater flow, and sediment transport. 

I am currently applying to Masters programs in Geosciences and summer internships in the mining and energy sectors, where I hope to build hands-on experience studying mineral resources and hydrogeologic systems.

Outside of academics, I enjoy off-roading, skiing, tennis, soccer, camping, and running, as well as exploring new landscapes and their geologic stories.

My most recent work with Santa Barbara Channelkeeper involved monitoring fishing, boating, and recreational activities in MPA’s along the coast. You can also find me at the The Honor Bar in Montecito, providing thoughtful and attentative service to our guests.
