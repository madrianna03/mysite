### Welcome!

Hello and welcome to my page! My name is Adrianna Martinez and I am completing my third year of undergrad at the University of California Santa Barbara. I am pursuing a Bachelor’s of Science in Environmental Studies with a minor in Earth Science. 

I grew up in the heart of Las Vegas, NV, where my passions for the outdoors and habitat preservation began to flourish, driving my academic and career goals today. I have always loved various outdoor activities such as off-roading, skiing, tennis, soccer, camping, and running. 

My most recent work with Santa Barbara Channelkeeper involved monitoring fishing, boating, and recreational activities in MPA’s along the coast. You can also find me at the The Honor Bar in Montecito, providing compassionate and upscale service to our guests. 

I am currently applying to Masters programs in Earth Sciences. With a new found love for rocks and plate tectonics, I hope to pursue a career path to becoming a geologist!
