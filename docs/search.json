Key components included land classification, contamination filtering, proximity analysis, and regression modeling.\n\nPart 1: Agricultural Land Area Calculation\nWe used Select, Intersect, Dissolve, and Field Calculator to calculate the percent area of cropland and ranchland per groundwater basin.\n\n\nPart 2: Domestic Wells and Land Use\nUsing Spatial Join, Union, and Clip, we filtered and merged domestic wells with cropland and ranchland overlays to assess shared basin locations.\n\n\nPart 3: Nitrate and Other Contaminants\nWells were filtered for key contaminants. Nitrate emerged as most significant (EPA MCL &gt;10 mg/L), and wells exceeding this were isolated for further analysis.\n\n\nPart 4: Proximity Analysis\nUsed the Near tool to calculate distance (km) from each well to nearest cropland and ranchland, enabling spatial exposure analysis.\n\n\nPart 5: Pesticide Use Integration\nStandardized county names and joined pesticide rates to the well dataset to allow exploration of fertilizer impact on contamination.\n\n\nPart 6: Linear Regression Analysis\nUsed OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) to model nitrate concentrations as a function of:\n- Percent cropland and ranchland in basin\n- Distance to cropland and ranchland\n- (Future work) Pesticide application rates"

Below are two of my favorite hobbies!\nGrowing up in the desert, my family often spent time off-roading, dirt bike riding, and camping. We would travel to the deserts of Utah, hit trails in South Lake Tahoe, and venture into the red rocks of the Las Vegas valley. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI love drawing and painting! I began practicing visual art in middle school and have expanded my artistic abilities over the years to watercolor, oil and acrylic, printmaking, charcoal and graphite, and ceramics. I love surrealism, incorporating landscapes, portraits, and vibrant colors into my works. Here you can see some of my favorite pieces and the inspiration behind each one.\n\n\n\n\nGrowing and Dying Acrylic on stretched canvas; a play on idealism amidst environmental crisis—the cycle of hope, fear, and mourning.\n\n\n\n\n\nMilk & Honey Mixed media painting exploring heaven, the realm where milk and honey flows.\n\n\n\n\n\nNatives A study of edible plants native to Santa Barbara area; assisted by indigenous knowledge.\n\n\n\n\n\nDesert Sun Inspired by desert camping trips; commissioned by family friends.\n\n\n\n\n\nLaying Lamb A soft-toned watercolor portrait of a lamb; a symbol of softness, vulnerability, and trust.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy Doves Surrealistic depiction of a dove; a meditation on peace and release."

My name is Adrianna Martinez and I am a first-generation student completing my fourth year of undergrad at the University of California Santa Barbara. I am pursuing a Bachelor’s of Science in Environmental Studies with a minor in Earth Science. \nGrowing up in the heart of Las Vegas, NV, my passion for the outdoors and appreciation for understanding environmental processes began to flourish, driving my academic and career goals today. Throughout undergrad, my curiosity towards geology quickly developed into a strong fascination with tectonics, fluids, and mineral systems, specifically how subduction, metamorphism, and crustal deformation influence ore deposit formation, groundwater flow, and sediment transport. \nI am currently applying to Masters programs in Geosciences and summer internships in the mining and energy sectors, where I hope to build hands-on experience studying mineral resources and hydrogeologic systems.\nOutside of academics, I enjoy off-roading, skiing, tennis, soccer, camping, and running, as well as exploring new landscapes and their geologic stories.\nMy most recent work with Santa Barbara Channelkeeper involved monitoring fishing, boating, and recreational activities in MPA’s along the coast. You can also find me at the The Honor Bar in Montecito, providing thoughtful and attentative service to our guests. \n\n\nEducation\nEnvironmental Studies B.S. and Earth Science Minor (2026) | University of California, Santa Barbara\nFaith Lutheran High School (2022)"

The effective element comes from seeing how different environments or habits affect my well-being and workflow across time, in a personal and relatable way.\n\nb.Sketch of Affective Visualization\n c. Draft of Visualization\n\n\nCode\n# Reshape and prepare the data (as before)\n\n# Load and prepare data\ndf &lt;- read_csv(\"data/ENVS193DS_personaldata_cleaned.csv\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    date = as.Date(date),\n    with_others = as.character(with_others),\n    caffeine_mg = as.character(caffeine_mg),\n    sleep_hrs = as.character(sleep_hrs),\n    location = as.character(location)\n  ) %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = c(with_others, caffeine_mg, sleep_hrs, location),\n    names_to = \"variable\",\n    values_to = \"value\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    # Re-bin caffeine and sleep\n    value = case_when(\n      variable == \"caffeine_mg\" ~ cut(as.numeric(value), breaks = 3, labels = c(\"Low\", \"Med\", \"High\")),\n      variable == \"sleep_hrs\" ~ cut(as.numeric(value), breaks = 3, labels = c(\"Low\", \"Med\", \"High\")),\n      TRUE ~ as.character(value)\n    ),\n    variable = factor(variable, levels = c(\"caffeine_mg\", \"sleep_hrs\", \"with_others\", \"location\"))\n  )\nfacet_labels &lt;- c(\n  caffeine_mg = \"Caffeine Intake\",\n  sleep_hrs = \"Sleep Duration\",\n  with_others = \"Social Context\",\n  location = \"Study Location\"\n)\n\n# Create the plot\nggplot(df, aes(x = date, y = productivity, group = value, color = value)) +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 1.2, alpha = 0.8) +\n  geom_point(size = 2.5) +\n  facet_wrap(~ variable, scales = \"free_x\", labeller = labeller(variable = facet_labels)) +\n  scale_color_brewer(palette = \"Set2\", name = \"Group\") +\n  scale_x_date(date_breaks = \"5 days\", date_labels = \"%b %d\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"How My Productivity Varies by Social Context, Caffeine, Sleep, and Study Location\",\n    x = \"Date\",\n    y = \"Productivity Score\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(\n    strip.text = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 14),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 16, hjust = 0.5),\n    legend.position = \"bottom\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArtist Statement\n\nMy piece explores how daily factors like caffeine intake, sleep hours, study location, and social setting influence my productivity. Through a series of faceted line charts, I visualize patterns in how these variables correlate with changes in my focus and energy over time.\nI was influenced by data storytelling techniques found in the work of Giorgia Lupi and the aesthetics of minimal data visualizations. Their ability to blend personal experience with visual clarity inspired me to turn routine self-tracking into a reflective and communicative work. The form of my work is a digital data visualization created using R and the ggplot2 package. It draws from principles of both statistical graphics and conceptual art to communicate. I created this piece by collecting daily data on my habits and productivity over several weeks, cleaning and reshaping the dataset, and then designing the plot to clearly represent each variable’s relationship with my performance. The use of color, faceting, and minimal design allows viewers to engage with the rhythms of my everyday life through an analytically aesthetic lens.\nPart 3: Statistical Critique a. Revisiting and Summarizing\nThe paper uses multiple linear regression (MLR) analysis. The response variable is the dolphin density per survey effort (DPSE). The predictor variables include environmental factors (temperature, salinity, water clarity, etc.), anthropogenic factors (high-speed ferry traffic, reclamation activities), and ecological factors (fish production).  b. Table 7 presents the MLR and PCR coefficients in a clear matrix format, broken down by region. Each cell contains a coefficient estimate with its standard error in parentheses, and asterisks mark statistically significant results. However, the table does not show any of the underlying data distributions or model diagnostics. While the tabular format is suitable for dense numeric summaries, it may be harder for readers to quickly compare effect sizes across variables without visual aids.\n\nThe table is mostly free of visual clutter and keeps a high data:ink ratio. It uses asterisks to draw attention to significant predictors, but it does not use bolding, color coding, or other emphasis techniques that might help highlight key findings more clearly. Overall, the presentation is functional but could benefit from design enhancements to help guide the reader’s attention to the most important results.\nTo improve Table 7, I would recommend breaking it into two visuals. A heatmap would show the strength and direction of the regression coefficients for each variable across subregions. The x-axis would represent the subregions, the y-axis would represent the predictor variables (salinity, ferry traffic, etc.), and fill color would represent the coefficient value (red to blue, intensity indicating magnitude). Asterisks or bold outlines could denote statistical significance based on a p-test.\n\nBar charts or dot plots with error bars for each subregion, showing the effect sizes of the most influential predictors would make it easier to interpret which variables had the strongest and most reliable impacts in each area."

    "text": "Site Overview\nBryce Canyon National Park is characterized by dramatic topography including high mesas, cliffs, and deep canyons. The park’s soils are primarily composed of Entisols and Aridisols, formed from sandstone and limestone parent materials. The region’s semiarid climate, combined with factors such as slope, elevation, and vegetation cover, creates diverse soil types that vary from deep, loamy soils in lowland areas to shallow, rocky soils on exposed ridges.\nTwo key soil types dominate the landscape:\n\nBrycan very fine sandy loam: Typically found on gentle slopes with fine texture that allows for moderate water retention\nPaunsaugunt gravelly loam: Located at higher elevations and steeper slopes, characterized by coarser texture and well-drained conditions"

    "text": "Key Findings\n\n\nSoil Distribution Patterns\nBryce Canyon features distinct soil zonation based on topography. Brycan very fine sandy loam dominates gentle slopes, while Paunsaugunt gravelly loam characterizes steeper, higher elevation areas, creating diverse growing conditions.\n\n\nMoisture Variation and Vegetation\nLowland areas with fine sandy loam retain more moisture, supporting diverse vegetation including grasses, forbs, and shrubs. Eolian-derived soils in these areas have higher moisture retention capacity due to their fine texture (Woods et al., 2001).\n\n\nPlant Adaptation Strategies\nUpland species like Utah juniper and pinyon pine thrive through specialized deep root systems that access water stored deeper in the soil profile. These adaptations allow survival in areas with coarser, well-drained soils (Graybosch & Buchanan, 1983; Stein, 1988).\n\n\nClimate Change Impacts\nDeclining snowfall and reduced evapotranspiration have shifted vegetation patterns toward species adapted to drier conditions, particularly affecting higher elevation areas where soil moisture is already limited (Carr et al., 2022; Hildebrand, 2012).\n\n\nParent Material Influence\nSoils formed from limestone parent material tend to be more alkaline and less fertile, limiting plant growth. In contrast, sandstone-derived soils have more neutral pH and better moisture retention, supporting more diverse vegetation (Marine, 1963).\n\n\nMicrohabitat Creation\nVariations in soil texture, depth, and water retention capacity create distinct microhabitats throughout the park. These differences determine which plant species can thrive in each area (Graybosch & Buchanan, 1983)."

    "text": "Discussion\nThe soils of Bryce Canyon are shaped by complex interactions of climate, topography, and parent material. The slower-draining soils in lowland areas (Brycan soils) provide more stable moisture conditions, supporting a variety of plants. In contrast, the coarser soils in upland areas (Paunsaugunt gravelly loam) promote plant species adapted to drier conditions.\nWoods et al. (2001) emphasize that areas with exposed bedrock, such as canyon walls and structural benches, have shallow, rocky soils less conducive to plant growth. These regions are dominated by species that can withstand harsh conditions including low nutrient availability and high evaporation rates.\nSoil-forming processes—including erosion, weathering, and deposition—play a fundamental role in determining which plant species can survive in different parts of the park. The combination of Quaternary colluvium, alluvium, and eolian materials shapes these soils, with variations in moisture availability directly affecting vegetation at each elevation and topographic position."
