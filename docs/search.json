    "text": "Welcome!\nHello and welcome to my page! My name is Adrianna Martinez and I am completing my third year of undergrad at the University of California Santa Barbara. I am pursuing a Bachelor’s of Science in Environmental Studies with a minor in Earth Science. \nI grew up in the heart of Las Vegas, NV, where my passions for the outdoors and habitat preservation began to flourish, driving my academic and career goals today. I have always loved various outdoor activities such as off-roading, skiing, tennis, soccer, camping, and running. \nMy most recent work with Santa Barbara Channelkeeper involved monitoring fishing, boating, and recreational activities in MPA’s along the coast. You can also find me at the The Honor Bar in Montecito, providing compassionate and upscale service to our guests. \nI am currently applying to Masters programs in Earth Sciences. With a new found love for rocks and plate tectonics, I hope to pursue a career path to becoming a geologist!\n\n\nEducation\nEnvironmental Studies B.S. and Earth Science Minor (2026) | University of California, Santa Barbara\nFaith Lutheran High School (2022)"

    "text": "I created this site to share my academic work and personal interests. Below are two of my favorite hobbies!\nGrowing up in the desert, my family often spent time off-roading, dirt bike riding, and camping. We would travel to the deserts of Utah, hit trails in South Lake Tahoe, and venture into the red rocks of the Las Vegas valley. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI love drawing and painting! I began practicing visual art in middle school and have expanded my artistic abilities over the years to watercolor, oil and acrylic, printmaking, charcoal and graphite, and ceramics. I love surrealism, incorporating landscapes, portraits, and vibrant colors into my works. Here you can see some of my favorite pieces and the inspiration behind each one.\n\n\n\n\nGrowing and Dying Acrylic on stretched canvas; a play on idealism amidst environmental crisis—the cycle of hope, fear, and mourning.\n\n\n\n\n\nMilk & Honey Mixed media painting exploring heaven, the realm where milk and honey flows.\n\n\n\n\n\nNatives A study of edible plants native to Santa Barbara area; assisted by indigenous knowledge.\n\n\n\n\n\nDesert Sun Inspired by desert camping trips; commissioned by family friends.\n\n\n\n\n\nLaying Lamb A soft-toned watercolor portrait of a lamb; a symbol of softness, vulnerability, and trust.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy Doves Surrealistic depiction of a dove; a meditation on peace and release."

Key components included land classification, contamination filtering, proximity analysis, and regression modeling.\n\nPart 1: Agricultural Land Area Calculation\nWe used Select, Intersect, Dissolve, and Field Calculator to calculate the percent area of cropland and ranchland per groundwater basin.\n\n\nPart 2: Domestic Wells and Land Use\nUsing Spatial Join, Union, and Clip, we filtered and merged domestic wells with cropland and ranchland overlays to assess shared basin locations.\n\n\nPart 3: Nitrate and Other Contaminants\nWells were filtered for key contaminants. Nitrate emerged as most significant (EPA MCL &gt;10 mg/L), and wells exceeding this were isolated for further analysis.\n\n\nPart 4: Proximity Analysis\nUsed the Near tool to calculate distance (km) from each well to nearest cropland and ranchland, enabling spatial exposure analysis.\n\n\nPart 5: Pesticide Use Integration\nStandardized county names and joined pesticide rates to the well dataset to allow exploration of fertilizer impact on contamination.\n\n\nPart 6: Linear Regression Analysis\nUsed OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) to model nitrate concentrations as a function of:\n- Percent cropland and ranchland in basin\n- Distance to cropland and ranchland\n- (Future work) Pesticide application rates"
