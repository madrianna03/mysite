    "text": "Welcome!\nHello and welcome to my page! My name is Adrianna Martinez and I am completing my third year of undergrad at the University of California Santa Barbara. I am pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s of Science in Environmental Studies with a minor in Earth Science.Â \nI grew up in the heart of Las Vegas, NV, where my passions for the outdoors and habitat preservation began to flourish, driving my academic and career goals today. I have always loved various outdoor activities such as off-roading, skiing, tennis, soccer, camping, and running.Â \nCurrently, I am working with Santa Barbara Channelkeeper, monitoring fishing, boating, and recreational activities in MPAâ€™s along the coast. You can also find me at the bowling alley, serving kids birthday parties, corporate events, and the bowling regulars.Â Â \nWith a new found love for rocks and plate tectonics, I hope to pursue a career path to becoming a geologist!\n\n\nEducation\nEnvironmental Studies B.S. and Earth Science Minor (2026) | University of California, Santa Barbara\nFaith Lutheran High School (2022)"

Below are two of my favorite hobbies!\nGrowing up in the desert, my family often spent time off-roading, dirt bike riding, and camping. We would travel to the deserts of Utah, hit trails in South Lake Tahoe, and venture into the red rocks of the Las Vegas valley.Â \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI love drawing and painting! I began practicing visual art in middle school and have expanded my artistic abilities over the years to watercolor, oil and acrylic, printmaking, charcoal and graphite, and ceramics. I love surrealism, incorporating landscapes, portraits, and vibrant colors into my works. Here you can see some of my favorite pieces and the inspiration behind each one.\n\n\n\n\nGrowing and Dying Acrylic on stretched canvas; a play on idealism amidst environmental crisisâ€”the cycle of hope, fear, and mourning.\n\n\n\n\n\nMilk & Honey Mixed media painting exploring heaven, the realm where milk and honey flows.\n\n\n\n\n\nNatives A study of edible plants native to Santa Barbara area; assisted by indigenous knowledge.\n\n\n\n\n\nDesert Sun Inspired by desert camping trips; commissioned by family friends.\n\n\n\n\n\nLaying Lamb A soft-toned watercolor portrait of a lamb; a symbol of softness, vulnerability, and trust.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy Doves Surrealistic depiction of a dove; a meditation on peace and release."

Through a series of faceted line charts, I visualize patterns in how these variables correlate with changes in my focus and energy over time.\nI was influenced by data storytelling techniques found in the work of Giorgia Lupi and the aesthetics of minimal data visualizations. Their ability to blend personal experience with visual clarity inspired me to turn routine self-tracking into a reflective and communicative work. The form of my work is a digital data visualization created using R and the ggplot2 package. It draws from principles of both statistical graphics and conceptual art to communicate. I created this piece by collecting daily data on my habits and productivity over several weeks, cleaning and reshaping the dataset, and then designing the plot to clearly represent each variableâ€™s relationship with my performance. The use of color, faceting, and minimal design allows viewers to engage with the rhythms of my everyday life through an analytically aesthetic lens.\nPart 3: Statistical Critique a. Revisiting and Summarizing\nThe paper uses multiple linear regression (MLR) analysis. The response variable is the dolphin density per survey effort (DPSE). The predictor variables include environmental factors (temperature, salinity, water clarity, etc.), anthropogenic factors (high-speed ferry traffic, reclamation activities), and ecological factors (fish production).  b. Table 7 presents the MLR and PCR coefficients in a clear matrix format, broken down by region. Each cell contains a coefficient estimate with its standard error in parentheses, and asterisks mark statistically significant results. However, the table does not show any of the underlying data distributions or model diagnostics. While the tabular format is suitable for dense numeric summaries, it may be harder for readers to quickly compare effect sizes across variables without visual aids.\n\nThe table is mostly free of visual clutter and keeps a high data:ink ratio. It uses asterisks to draw attention to significant predictors, but it does not use bolding, color coding, or other emphasis techniques that might help highlight key findings more clearly. Overall, the presentation is functional but could benefit from design enhancements to help guide the readerâ€™s attention to the most important results.\nTo improve Table 7, I would recommend breaking it into two visuals. A heatmap would show the strength and direction of the regression coefficients for each variable across subregions. The x-axis would represent the subregions, the y-axis would represent the predictor variables (salinity, ferry traffic, etc.), and fill color would represent the coefficient value (red to blue, intensity indicating magnitude). Asterisks or bold outlines could denote statistical significance based on a p-test.\n\nBar charts or dot plots with error bars for each subregion, showing the effect sizes of the most influential predictors would make it easier to interpret which variables had the strongest and most reliable impacts in each area."

Current oversight is insufficientâ€”stricter tracking, audits, and safer disposal methods are urgently needed.\nCultural site and Indigenous rights violations\nProposed projects threaten ancestral lands and sacred sites like Obsidian Butte. Existing consultation processes fall short of UN FPIC standards and must be reformed to center Indigenous leadership.\nSeismic risks from geothermal expansion\nThe Imperial Valleyâ€™s location on the San Andreas Fault raises concerns about induced seismicity. Geothermal infrastructure must meet higher engineering standards and include real-time seismic monitoring.\nCumulative impact assessments are lacking\nExisting environmental reviews fail to account for the combined effects of lithium, geothermal, and regional water stressâ€”comprehensive EIAs must become mandatory for all new projects."

The project evaluates environmental, social, and economic dimensions of Californiaâ€™s push for domestic battery mineral production in support of its clean energy goals."

    "text": "Freshwater strain from DLE operations\nDirect lithium extraction (DLE) is more efficient than evaporation methods but still consumes significant freshwater from the Colorado River, a source already facing severe depletion.\nAir quality and Salton Sea risks\nLithium development could worsen Imperial Valleyâ€™s already poor air quality by accelerating Salton Sea shrinkage, exposing pesticide-laden playa dust that exacerbates respiratory illnesses.\nHazardous waste gaps\nDLE generates solid waste that often contains heavy metals like arsenic and lead. Current oversight is insufficientâ€”stricter tracking, audits, and safer disposal methods are urgently needed.\nCultural site and Indigenous rights violations\nProposed projects threaten ancestral lands and sacred sites like Obsidian Butte. Existing consultation processes fall short of UN FPIC standards and must be reformed to center Indigenous leadership.\nSeismic risks from geothermal expansion\nThe Imperial Valleyâ€™s location on the San Andreas Fault raises concerns about induced seismicity. Geothermal infrastructure must meet higher engineering standards and include real-time seismic monitoring.\nCumulative impact assessments are lacking\nExisting environmental reviews fail to account for the combined effects of lithium, geothermal, and regional water stressâ€”comprehensive EIAs must become mandatory for all new projects."
