    "text": "Welcome!\nHello and welcome to my page! My name is Adrianna Martinez and I am completing my third year of undergrad at the University of California Santa Barbara. I am pursuing a Bachelor’s of Science in Environmental Studies with a minor in Earth Science. \nI grew up in the heart of Las Vegas, NV, where my passions for the outdoors and habitat preservation began to flourish, driving my academic and career goals today. I have always loved various outdoor activities such as off-roading, skiing, tennis, soccer, camping, and running. \nCurrently, I am working with Santa Barbara Channelkeeper, monitoring fishing, boating, and recreational activities in MPA’s along the coast. You can also find me at the bowling alley, serving kids birthday parties, corporate events, and the bowling regulars.  \nWith a new found love for rocks and plate tectonics, I hope to pursue a career path to becoming a geologist!\n\n\nEducation\nEnvironmental Studies B.S. and Earth Science Minor (2026) | University of California, Santa Barbara\nFaith Lutheran High School (2022)"

    "text": "I created this site to share my academic work and personal interests. Below are two of my favorite hobbies!\nGrowing up in the desert, my family often spent time off-roading, dirt bike riding, and camping. We would travel to the deserts of Utah, hit trails in South Lake Tahoe, and venture into the red rocks of the Las Vegas valley. \n\n   \n\nI love drawing and painting! I began practicing visual art in middle school and have expanded my artistic abilities over the years to watercolor, oil and acrylic, printmaking, charcoal and graphite, and ceramics. I love surrealism, incorporating landscapes, portraits, and vibrant colors into my works. Here you can see some of my favorite pieces and the inspiration behind each one.\n\n\n\n\nGrowing and Dying Acrylic on stretched canvas; a play on idealism amidst environmental crisis—the cycle of hope, fear, and mourning.\n\n\n\n\n\nMilk & Honey Mixed media painting exploring heaven, the realm where milk and honey flows.\n\n\n\n\n\nNatives A study of edible plants native to Santa Barbara area; assisted by indigenous knowledge.\n\n\n\n\n\nDesert Sun Inspired by desert camping trips; commissioned by family friends.\n\n\n\n\n\nLaying Lamb A soft-toned watercolor portrait of a lamb; a symbol of softness, vulnerability, and trust.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy Doves Surrealistic depiction of a dove; a meditation on peace and release."
