I created this site to share my academic work and personal interests. Below are two of my favorite hobbies!

Growing up in the desert, my family often spent time off-roading, dirt bike riding, and camping. We would travel to the deserts of Utah, hit trails in South Lake Tahoe, and venture into the red rocks of the Las Vegas valley.

I love drawing and painting! I began practicing visual art in middle school and have expanded my artistic abilities over the years to watercolor, oil and acrylic, printmaking, charcoal and graphite, and ceramics. I love surrealism, incorporating landscapes, portraits, and vibrant colors into my works. Here you can see some of my favorite pieces and the inspiration behind each one.
