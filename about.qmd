I created this site to share my academic work and personal interests. Below are two of my favorite hobbies!

Growing up in the desert, my family often spent time off-roading, dirt bike riding, and camping. We would travel to the deserts of Utah, hit trails in South Lake Tahoe, and venture into the red rocks of the Las Vegas valley.Â
